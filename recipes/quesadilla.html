        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Quesadillas came to be when Spaniards brought dairy products (not to mention, cows) to Mexico in the 1500s. 
            Mexicans combined cheese (queso) with tortillas and created a number of delicious combinations, including the quesadilla.</p>
        <p>In its most basic form, a quesadilla is simply a grilled tortilla with melted cheese inside. 
            It is the Mexican grilled cheese, if you will, and you can add additional fillings if you would like.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole-grain flour tortilla </li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup cooked black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped red bell pepper or jarred roasted bell pepper or a few thinly sliced cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped red onion or green onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeño (if you like heat)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon avocado oil, melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. 
                Warm your tortilla for about 30 seconds, flipping halfway. 
                Flip once more, then sprinkle one-half of the tortilla with about half of the cheese. 
                Cover the cheese evenly with the remaining fillings: beans, bell pepper, onion and jalapeño (if using).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the fillings, 
                and fold over the empty side of the tortilla to enclose the fillings. 
                Quickly brush the top of the quesadilla with a light coating of oil, 
                then carefully flip it with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 1 to 2 minutes, 
                reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla. 
                Brush the top with a light coating of oil, then flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. 
                Let it cool for a minute to give the cheese time to set, then use a knife to slice it into 3 pieces. 
                Serve promptly, with any sauces or garnishes that you would like.</li>
        </ol>
